This is Khoi Pham's online portfolio! The tabs up top are the different organizations he has done projects for, as well as some personal projects. 

Background
======
Khoi is a Junior at the University of Texas at Austin, studying Mechanical Engineering. At UT, alongside school, his primary focus is the Longhorn Racing Team (combustion), where he is the surrent Manufacturing lead, helping other students make properly toleranced and machinable designs, as well as both machining parts and guiding other students through the machining process.

At his previous internship/co-op, Contoro Robotics, Khoi designed mechanical components/systems and tested flow characteristics for a robotics end effector which grasped cardboard boxes from floor-loaded shipping containers (see the Contoro Robotics tab for more).
